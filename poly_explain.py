# POLYMORPHISM
# use of one single entity (method) from different objects
name = 'Jim' #str
print(len(name))

some_list = ['some', 'name'] #list
print(len(some_list))
# That's polymorphism in action, a single built-in function(len)
# does know how to handle different kinds of objects as expected!!
